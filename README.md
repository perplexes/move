I hate controllers. Model and Views only for Rails, and your "View" is made up of a DAG of View objects, who, when rendered in a particular order, yeild a page. Should that page POST or PUT somewhere, we construct that View tree and give it the data, and it'll figure out what to do with it - whether update the associated models, complain you're not logged in, or say you don't have permission to do that thing you're trying.
